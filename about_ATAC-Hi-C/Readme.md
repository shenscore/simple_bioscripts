## TODO list
1. need to get peak-peak contact, peak-not_peak contact, not_peak-notpeak contact  
    1. call peaks with macs2 
    2. extract focucing contact by a script in which the core function is to check whether the  two contact loci are in any of the peak.
    3. visualized the extracted contact by juicer tools pre.
    4. need convert mnd to bed or bam format ; Not use traditional mapping strategy cause some reads contain ligation site
