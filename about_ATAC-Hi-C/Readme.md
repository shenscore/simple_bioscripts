## TODO list
1. need to get peak-peak contact, peak-not_peak contact, not_peak-notpeak contact  
    1. call peaks with macs2 
    2. extract focucing contact by a script in which the core function is to check whether the  two contact loci are in any of the peak.
    3. visualized the extracted contact by juicer tools pre.
